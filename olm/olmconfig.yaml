  **About Amazon MQ**


  Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ
  that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers on AWS. Amazon MQ
  reduces your operational responsibilities by managing the provisioning, setup,
  and maintenance of message brokers for you. Because Amazon MQ connects to your
  current applications with industry-standard APIs and protocols, you can easily
  migrate to AWS without having to rewrite code.
